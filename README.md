# 🔧 Functions in C Programming

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains programs demonstrating the use of **functions** in the C programming language.  
Functions are essential building blocks in C — they allow code reusability, modular design, and improved readability.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
The programs in this project cover:
- **Built-in functions** (like `printf()`, `scanf()`, etc.)
- **User-defined functions**
- **Functions with and without parameters**
- **Functions with and without return values**
- **Recursive functions**
- **Function declarations and prototypes**
- **Call by value vs Call by reference**

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this repository is to help learners:
- Understand how to define and call functions in C.  
- Learn the concept of parameters and return values.  
- Practice modular programming using functions.  
- Explore recursion and its use cases.
